Every year around Christmas, (Advent of Code)[https://adventofcode.com/2020] does a
fun little series of coding challenges. Akin to an advent calendar, each day
unlocks a new challenge to do. I'm off to a late start (X-mas 2020 is already
behind us), but I've been enjoying working through the challenges.

I don't expect anyone to peruse the code, except for future-me. Some of my
solutions are reasonably clean and well-done, others are a bit of a hot mess.
A few of the early ones were used to dust off my C++, but most are in Python
because why not do a fun coding challenge in a fun language?

Happy Pandemic Holidays!
